To develop an authentication module and user management APIs in Node.js, we'll implement the following steps:

Set Up Project:
Use Express.js for handling the HTTP requests.
Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
Store user data in a MongoDB database.
Features:
Signup: Register a new user with email, password, etc.
Login: Authenticate the user with a JWT token.
Logout: Token invalidation (though typically tokens are client-managed, we'll implement a basic logout).
CRUD Operations: Manage users with basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
Libraries/Technologies:
express: For building the API.
jsonwebtoken: For generating and verifying JWT tokens.
bcryptjs: For password hashing.
mongoose: For interacting with MongoDB.
dotenv: For environment variable management.
